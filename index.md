# Alexis LUCAS - IT Engineer Student

> /!\ I'm looking for a 20-weeks internship abroad (in an English speaking country), preferably in a start-up. /!\

Currently finishing the first-year in engineering cycle of IT engineering school, my specialization is web and mobile software development. During my training in [eXia.Cesi](https://exia.cesi.fr/), I have learned many languages, frameworks, and architectures and I have also learned where and how to use them. But aside my education, I am always trying to develop my knowledge by working on personal projects such as private websites and try to learn a lot more than the school program covers.

I have used my skills and knowledge in internships. Two of them were about web development, and the last one was about cross-platform mobile development. For my next internship, I would like to work in the full stack development field using recent technologies. Being part of a large scale project in this domain is particularly interesting to me.
Please contact me by mail (alexis.lucas1@viacesi.fr).
